Another day, another failed museum visit. This time, the museum was a bit
further afield: the Seoul Museum of Chicken Art (as in art about chickens,
not art made of chicken, although maybe there also would have been some of
the latter) is a two-hour subway/train slog from downtown Seoul, about 2km
north of the final stop on Metro line 1. Unfortunately for us, the museum
was closed; I guess they were doing some construction in the area, or
maybe it just didn't get enough visitors with the remote location. Oh well.

Consolation prize: a hike up into the Soyosan mountains. There's a cluster
of peaks connected by ridges, each about 500m in elevation, accessible
via a network of hiking trails. Some of the trails we took had us scrambling
along dried-up streams, rocky ledges, and overgrown forest paths. Definitely
different from the mostly immaculate trails available to American hikers!
The hike to the top takes roughly an hour from Soyosan station, but you
can find full-day and even multi-day loops in the area.

On the way up, you
first pass through a fairly level stretch that follows one of the streambeds.
The day we visited was the day before Korean Independence Day, so this part
was swarming with families and retirees - it being a popular pastime to sit
down by the stream, maybe take an extended picnic, dip your feet in the water,
and...break out the boombox for some background music. We could hear the
music, mostly blends of K-pop with some more traditional ballad-y stuff,
reverberating all the way up to the peaks...

Then you enter a temple complex, complete with cave shrines and ceremonial
entrance gates. Every so often, the near-silence is punctuated by hikers
ringing a small bell on one of the gates as they pass. We also spot a modern
logistical convenience of the temple: a sort of lawnmower engine rigged to
a track for moving heavy objects (stone blocks, for instance, or other
construction materials) up to the main temple grounds. Summer is apparently
construction season here as well, even in these mountains.

Once at the top, we're rewarded with some magnificent views of the surrounding
countryside. It's a bit hazy, and many of the views are partially obstructed
by trees (after all, these peaks aren't high enough to clear the treeline!),
but awesome nonetheless. Seems like an adequate consolation prize for missing
out on chicken art! Also, it feels good to get in a solid hike without the
packs on - much easier, especially in this muggy heat.

Then it's back to Seoul for one last night at the hostel. We meet up with
someone we met in the hostel and head to Bibap, a food-themed nonverbal
musical based around beatboxing and breakdancing. It's definitely a silly
touristy thing, but one of the more awesome silly touristy things out
there, so we don't mind! Afterwards, we feel obligated to pick up some
bibimbap, or "mixed rice" - the name of the musical is a play off this
famous Korean dish. Yum!

We're super-excited for tomorrow, since we're meeting up with Taejin and
Solhee at the SuperSonic music festival! Yay!
