<em>Life, disappearing,<br/>
Hiding in boxes, backpacks,<br/>
The Zen of packing.</em>

In less than 24 hours, we'll be on a plane!  Today we're packing, prepping our room for our summer subletters, and doing some final digital preparation.  We're finally pushing <a href="http://expedition.savageinter.net">expedition!</a> live for you all to test out.  If you want an invitation, please email us!

I had the epic fortune of <a href="https://plus.google.com/110733550616262601277/posts/HMNDSPuAFGY">breaking my finger</a> over the weekend, but it sounds like it's going to be ok.  I just have to keep it in a splint for the next three weeks, and after that start exercising it to get my range of motion back.

We've actually got more space than we know what to do with, given that we aren't bringing camping equipment, a stove, or bike tools; anyway, our backpacks are much, much larger than the panniers we had with us on <a href="http://fearlesstost.github.io/biketotheearth">our last trip</a>.  What will we fill them with?  Who knows!
