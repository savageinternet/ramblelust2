First full relaxation day in Seogwipo, and we are **exhausted**. We lumber
out of bed at something like 0900 in no state to move anywhere.
Miraculously, our muscles aren't overly sore; it's more of a pervasive general
fatigue that reaches into every part of our bodies, making even the idea
of physical activity anathema. So we lie about for a bit, reading and playing
games and generally working up the strength to go get the food we know we
need.

Finally we succeed in getting out the door (good thing we're on the second
floor, and not the fifth or something) and to breakfast. With some food in
our stomachs, we can at last contemplate doing something, and we settle on
Seogwipo Submarine as a suitably lazy form of entertainment. Besides,
"ride in a submarine" is on Valkyrie's bucket list, and when else are we going
to have this kind of opportunity? It's settled; we amble down (yes, actually
walking somewhere!) to the port, fork over 55 000 KRW each (about 50 USD), and
are soon on our submarine adventure!

There's a quick ferry ride out to the submarine, punctuated by K-pop and all
manner of incomprehensible announcements in Korean. We shrug and peer out the
windows, watching the port grow smaller as we head out for the submarine dock.
Jeju's southern coast around Seogwipo has a series of tall barrier islands,
presumably the eroded remains of offshore oreums; these are host to beautiful
soft coral blooms, and the one we're aiming for even has a shipwreck down at
40m! The Seogwipo Submarine experience is definitely touristy, but likely worth
it if a) you can put that aside and b) you've never been in a submarine before.

Having completed our PADI Open Water Diver course earlier in this trip, it's
also cool to see what there is below 18m: less light, different types of fish...
the light really does taper off quickly, although it's not as dark as we
expected it would be when the submarine bottoms out at 42m depth. The shipwreck
is actually pretty recent, about 10 years old - a mackerel fishing boat that
hit some bad weather and sank, though fortunately the crew all made it out
alive. One of the staff is a proper polyglot; he chats us up in decent
English before trying out his Chinese on the family next to us. (They give up
on this, though, and ask him to speak English, which tarnishes the polyglot
image somewhat. Still, credit for effort!)

Did I mention we're still exhausted? After the submarine ride, we make it as
far as the convenience store just up the road before hailing a taxi for the
uphill slog back to the guesthouse. We feel absolutely no shame about this,
having just completed eight half-marathons in ten days with 15kg packs in
sauna-like weather. No wonder we're dead tired!

The rest of the day is definitely uneventful: we grab lunch at the 15 bowls
place again, though we get their bibimbap instead; we spend a while lolling
about in a trendy cafe just opposite the museum; we get some more food while
walking back through the market; we nap and read some more before stepping
out for dinner, then nap and read even more. Exercise-induced fatigue is
no joke: as top coaches and athletes know well, overtraining can leave you
much weaker for as long as a week while you recover. We're definitely feeling
that sort of thing now.

Given our condition, we resolve to take an extra rest day here. Actually, taking
a realistic look at our itinerary, we haven't got time to complete the circuit
of Jeju in this weather - not unless we want to collapse Pheidippides-style at
the end! Maybe we'll use the excellent bus system to get around to some of
the more popular trails, then spend a bit of extra time taking the ferry/train
combo back to Seoul. It's always good to have flexible plans...
