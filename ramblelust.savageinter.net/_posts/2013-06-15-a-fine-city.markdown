Bleary-eyed wakeup call at 0845. The two Nederlanders in the far corner are
curled up in a semi-catatonic fetal position, tapping absently at their phones.
I don't think they've moved since last night. Valkyrie gets up for a shower
while I lay in bed failing to catch some final Zs. We're meeting Rob, a
friend of the brother of a friend, at his hostel two blocks away at 0900.
We're not quite getting used to the perma-sauna of Singapore's equatorial
climate: 30Â°C with 60+% humidity 24/7/365.

We all head for Chinatown on the MRT to meet Alyssa for dim sum at
[Yum Cha](http://goo.gl/maps/3HkxG). Several plates of dumplings, cakes,
and buns later, we waddle out into the sweltering heat for a pilgrimage to
Singapore's shopping mecca, Orchard Road. (I think warily of Singapore's
sizeable Muslim population as I write this; surely some special hell awaits
those who pervert the name of Mecca in this way.)

Orchard Road lives up to its reputation: multiple kilometres of shopping malls,
all connected by a warren of precisely climate-controlled underground passages.
Maybe it's the general exhaustion, the heat, or one too many vegetable-less
meals, but the mall-city aesthetic is wearing thin. We've learned to spot
malls by their ultra-modernist exteriors, many bearing a strange resemblance
to oversized gift boxes. We snap up some durian puffs, which have an initial
taste not unlike fruity mushy tuna salad and a lingering hint of creamy
onion - worth trying once, perhaps.

Valkyrie and I split off for a quick nap at the hostel, then set off to
Bugis Junction in search of food. We settle on [laksa](http://www.laksa.com/images/laksa2.jpg),
a spicy seafood-meat-vegetable-coconut stew that can also be found in
[goreng](http://www.laksania.com/laksagoreng.html) form. Then it's off to
the Botanic Gardens, which more closely resemble a large park than your
cramped Western botanical gardens. They showcase largely native flora - rather,
they showcase what would have been native before every last patch of tropical
rainforest swamp was filled in, sprayed to eradicate disease-carrying
insects, and zoned for development. There's not much land in Singapore, so
building housing for 5 million people and counting poses a unique spatial
challenge.

While at the Gardens, we head over to the Shaw Symphony Stage for a concert
of selections from various operas. Alyssa is part of the [Singapore Symphony
Chorus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Symphony_Chorus), which
provides a beautiful accompaniment to the orchestra as they wind through
the operatic legacies of Mozart, Puccini, Rossini, and other such luminaries.
One of the lead soloists, William, exudes a technical vibe: when he's not
delivering a solid vocal performance, he's clearing his throat or adjusting
his square-rimmed glasses. As Silicon Valley natives ourselves, we share a
laugh over this: we can picture him as the staid engineer type who enjoys
daily post-work opera practice in the comfort of his minimally decorated
yet meticulously organized downtown apartment. All this is hearsay, of course,
but it makes a compelling image. Every third person in the audience has some
sort of fan, which means either that they're tourists (unlikely) or that even
Singaporeans haven't quite adjusted to the cloying heat...but we put such
thoughts aside and enjoy the flawlessly executed music.

We almost head over to the Night Safari afterwards, but decide at the last
minute to take a winding walk through the Botanic Gardens before hopping the
MRT back to Bugis Junction. There we indulge in some bizarre
entertainment: [Garena Stadium](http://stadium.garena.com/) is broadcasting
a live [League of Legends](http://lol.garena.com/playnow/anniversary2013/)
tournament, and we manage to get seats for a Singapore-Manila match.
They're actually broadcasting on location - the two announcers are over in the
corner on greenscreen, and the five Singapore players are lined up at front
as the audience watches five massive screens that jump around to various
game hotspots. Meanwhile, there's a teenage beauty contest going on in the
mall atrium below, with throngs of onlookers crowding the surrounding
balconies. The malls really are the cultural centers of Singapore...
