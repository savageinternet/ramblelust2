...is where we'll be in just over an hour. I'm writing this from a passably
comfortable chair in the A Gates at SFO International Terminal, as we get in our
last-minute Internet fix before packing ourselves into a series of giant metal
tubes for 36 hours: San Francisco -> Shanghai -> Sydney -> Cairns.

(If that sounds geographically perverse, that's because it is!)

This trip brings us to a brand new continent (Australia) for about a week
before taking us further into one we've nominally visited before (Asia). On our
[bike trip](http://fearlesstost.github.io/biketotheearth/), we crossed the
Bosphorus into Asian Ä°stanbul. A while back, we also spent
[two weeks in Japan](https://plus.google.com/photos/112473489641783705028/albums/5290167649950225617?banner=pwa),
just barely enough time to overcome jet lag :)

Where into Asia? Well, we have Vietnamese visae valid from Jun 8 - Jul 8, so
we're likely headed there first. After that, we have no idea!

Bag weigh-in: Evan's bag is 4.6 kg, Valkyrie's is 8.2 kg. The difference comes
from our snorkeling gear, which we plan to put to good use over at the Great
Barrier Reef!
