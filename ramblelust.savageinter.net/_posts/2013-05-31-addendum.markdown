<em>Shuff'ling, zombie-like,<br/>
Gate, gate, airplane, delay lounge,<br/>
A sleepy cycle...</em>

Well, here we are, still in Pudong International Airport, and all my gushing about China Eastern Airlines is being put to shame.  Some kind of mechanical failure kept us on the plane for two hours, grounded, and now we've been cattle-style herded into a waiting lounge.  Evan is sleeping (again), and I'm melting (again).  We've already lost the window to make our flight from Sydney to Cairns, but fortunately a kind Aussie seated behind us eavesdropped on our panicked conversation and amiably offered his phone for us to contact our host.  We sent an SMS that floated through the Chinese cell network and hopefully found its way through the firewall and subsequent tubes to Australia...
