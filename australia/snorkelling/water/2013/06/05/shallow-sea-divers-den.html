    <p>Three full days in Cairns and we haven’t been to the reef yet! In order to
fix that, we booked a snorkelling day trip with Deep Sea Diver’s Den, one
of the local dive/snorkel outfits. (We later learned that they’ve hit the
reef a couple of times over the last year - friendly, but maybe not the most
professional. Hmm.)</p>

<p>So it’s on the 6:59 am bus into the Cairns Transit Mall, then a short walk over
to Finger B at the marina where we hop onboard their catamaran. Some light
paperwork and money exchange later, we’re rocketing out towards the Outer
Reef at 22 knots (about 40 km/h.) It’s a long and bouncy trip out, about an
hour and a half over waves several feet tall, but finally we’re out at a
<a href="http://diversden.com.au/snorkelling.htm">cluster of reefs</a>
where we can hop in the water and see some awesome stuff!</p>

<p>There’s loads of beautiful coral both soft and hard in every color
and shape imaginable. Most of these have common names after the objects they
look like: rock coral, needle coral, fan coral, etc. Not much vegetation
around the reef, but what it lacks in kelp and the like it more than makes up
for in other wildlife. We saw a bunch of parrot fish, some in brilliant RGB
color palettes. We spotted some Nemos, or clownfish; the true ones are clown
anemonefish, apparently, and we saw some in the anemones. There were
triggerfish, sergeant majors, and a whole lot more - the coral really does
hide an amazing diversity of life!</p>

<p>More personally, I’m relieved that I was able to hold myself together; after
that episode a couple of days ago, I was worried we’d have to cancel the trip.
Now that I’m mostly over the jet-lag and have returned to my previous
treatments, though, it seems to be much better - not 100%, but enough to
enjoy what we came here for.</p>

<p>Back in Cairns, we pop over to get our dive medicals. Pro tip: even if you’re
not planning to dive, this is a fantastic and relatively cheap way to get a
thorough physical. The medical runs AUD 50-60 and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full medical history check;</li>
  <li>urine test;</li>
  <li>the usual height, weight, and blood pressure/heart rate check;</li>
  <li>hearing range test;</li>
  <li>Ishihara color-blindness test;</li>
  <li>spirometry, or lung capacity/flow test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely more complete than the last checkup I got back home!</p>

<p>We pass the dive medical, so afterwards we head over to book our PADI Open
Water Dive Course! Some places will offer discounted standby rates for
last-minute bookings; we manage to get $100 knocked off the price for a
5-day course that includes a 3-day, 2-night liveaboard at the end, starting
tomorrow at early o’clock. Super exciting!</p>

<p>After that, we sate our hunger at Happy 4 10, a cute Korean joint tucked
away in a sort of courtyard lot between other buildings. They serve up
delicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteokbokki">tteokbokki</a> on one of
those single-burner propane stoves with K-pop music videos blaring in the
background, which is definitely surreal after a day out snorkelling. The
tteokbokki is deliciously messy, and we leave full with our fronts well-sauced
and some extra takeaway for breakfast.</p>

<p>So: snorkelling, dive medicals, booking the PADI course, and delicious Korean
food. What a day!</p>
