    <p>So we’ve got this crazy plan to rent a bike and circumnavigate the island. There
are a few glaring problems with this plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s harder to find a bike rental shop than we think. (Maybe that’s because we
start looking in Little India, which we soon discover is not at all the right
place to look; Chinatown proves a more fruitful district to search.)</li>
  <li>Rental shops mostly have one-speed beaters. The more reputable places have
well-maintained one-speed bikes. There are a lot of hills on Pulau Pinang.</li>
  <li>It’s 60km around the island on road, much of it over the aforementioned hills,
and the weather is akin to a permanent sauna in midday.</li>
  <li>Did we mention Malaysia isn’t very pedestrian-friendly? Well, it’s not very
cyclist-friendly either.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, we abandon the plan and settle for the more modest goal of
reaching Batu Ferringhi, which is only 20km away without giant hills blocking
our path. Given the other problems, even this turns out to be difficult: the
coastal road is mostly flat, but not always, and despite the reassuring bike
path signs has neither bike lanes nor any obvious affordance for cyclists.
That’s OK; we’re crazy (or stubborn) enough to make it to Batu Ferringhi, which
is mostly a resort town with some nice beaches. We were hoping to find the system
of hiking trails that connect some of the beaches on Pulau Pinang, but that
doesn’t work out either; we’re pretty wiped from the ride over, and we still
have to ride back!</p>

<p>Practical note on renting bikes: we got ours for 10 RM/day each. The first place
we checked offered 15 RM/day. No idea how much lower you can drive the price, but
probably not much.</p>

<p>A couple of coconuts to fix our dehydration and it’s back on the bikes to Pulau
Pinang again. When we tell the rental shop that we went all the way to Batu
Ferringhi, he looks at us with a curious mixture of approval, disbelief, and
horror. Approval because, in the owner’s words, “Batu Ferringhi has the <em>only</em>
good beaches on Pulau Pinang”; disbelief because, well, it’s a touch more
ambitious than the usual itinerary around Georgetown’s city core; horror
because, as we found, the coastal road is a dangerous place to be
non-motorized!</p>

<p>We’ve still got some time to kill in Georgetown, so we set off on a hunt for
street art. There’s a series of cat-themed installations, everything from
murals to sculptures to usable seating areas - about 20 in all. Aside from
that, there’s also several educational wireframe pieces about the history
of Georgetown. We happen upon one of the jettys, a ramshackle collection of
huts and shacks perched on a pier and permeated by the stench of
seaweed rotting below. (If you can ignore that, though, it’s oddly picturesque.)</p>

<p>Busy day, and we’re headed for Malacca early tomorrow, so it’s back home for
some much-needed dinner and sleep!</p>
