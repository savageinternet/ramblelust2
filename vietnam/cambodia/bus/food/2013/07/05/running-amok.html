    <p>Yay! After groaning through much of the last week, we have something exciting
to look forward to: a new country, the Kingdom of Cambodia! Our bus leaves
at 0830, so we get up at 0730 for some quick breakfast. There’s also one
administrative detail to attend to: the guy who rented the motorbike to us
is asking 200 000 VND (10 USD) for repairs to the left side, which was a bit
scuffed up during our spill.</p>

<p>The bus itself is this Japanese export, as evidenced by the various labels on
buttons and knobs. It’s relatively clean, onboard toilet, seats a touch hard
to sit on after all that bouncing around on the motorbike. Getting out of
Saigon is slow going, made worse by the fact that this is day two of the
Vietnamese university entrance exams. You can see hordes of youth at the
examination centres, some beaming with pride while others fight back tears
from the early morning session. They clog the streets on motorbikes, each
with tiny knapsacks, maybe a notebook or two stuffed into the space between
knees and front wheel column. We gradually get into the outskirts of the
city. Valkyrie and I discuss plans for Expedition; the hours pass, and soon
enough we’re at the Bavet crossing into Cambodia.</p>

<p>Here we get off the bus, go inside, have the Vietnamese border guards inspect
our visas and stamp us out, walk back outside, grab our packs, go through
the Vietnamese metal detectors because they forgot to staff them earlier,
haul our packs over to the Cambodian border station, step inside, hand over
our passports and immigration cards to receive Cambodian visas, put our
stuff back on the bus, and head down the road a slight bit for lunch.</p>

<p>First impressions of Cambodia: the main roads are newer than in Vietnam, and
consequently still of reasonably good quality; there’s a LOT of development
in the border area, much of it casinos and hotels; similar to Vietnam, the
countryside and small towns lack much in the way of infrastructure; they
do indeed use USD as the main currency, with Cambodian rials used only for
small purchases; food seems like halfway between Thai and Vietnamese, with
a greater range of curries and slightly different spices/herbs. Of course,
all of this is based on cursory inspection from the main route, and maybe
won’t hold up to further exploration.</p>

<p>As we get into the city, more surprises: there are indeed a lot of newly
paved roads. Traffic is less chaotic than in Saigon, with a much higher
car-to-motorbike ratio, and petrol is slightly more expensive. Phnom Penh
is on average (at least near the city center!) cleaner and more modernized
than Saigon, owing perhaps to both a massive influx of tourist money and a
rapidly modernizing economy supported partially by investment on newly
discovered oil fields in national waters.</p>

<p>We get off at one of the downtown markets, and immediately have to fight
through a crowd of tuk-tuk drivers to get our bags. The cry of
“Hello? Sir? You want tuk-tuk?” soon becomes a familiar sound. (If you’re not
familiar with this: a tuk-tuk is a motorbike taxi that tows a seating area,
usually covered, in rear. There is no meter or agreed-upon rate, and so every
transaction is an adventure: you have to negotiate with your driver as to
route and price.) We decline, since we and Google Maps both have the sneaking
suspicion that accommodation can be found without much walking, and fortunately
Valkyrie’s knee is mending quickly enough that she feels up to hoofing it.</p>

<p>There are still glimpses of French influence to be caught: our first food
in Phnom Penh is actually ice cream from a parlor run by a French expat.
I order a scoop of soursop, while Valkyrie opts for a banana-chocolate crepe.
We have an ulterior motive: the ice cream shop has wifi, which enables us to
look up reviews of hostels, hotels, and guesthouses in the area. It also
turns out to be extremely good timing on our part, for we duck inside just as
it starts pouring.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, after walking past the Central Market and over towards
the river, we’re checked into the first windowless room we’ve stayed in,
not counting our one night in a capsule hotel back on our trip to Japan.
It’s clean enough, though, and reasonably close to the main downtown
attractions. With accommodation taken care of, we’re feeling a bit peckish,
so we decide to head out on another walk: this time, we’re headed for the
cluster of restaurants on 278 Street, where we hope to find some decent
amok. On our way, we pass a beautiful temple complex, the imposing outer wall
of the Royal Palace grounds, Wat Botum park, something that looks suspiciously
like a Cambodian rendition of the Arc de Triomphe,
and a few touristy joints before settling on Tom Yum Kung Thai Restaurant.
The <strong>amok</strong>, little pouches of steamed fish in curry sauce, is delicious;
we accompany it with a tasty pumpkin stew and a mango salad, and wash the
whole lot down with fresh coconut juice from whole coconuts. Yum!</p>

<p>After that, we amble back to the hostel, ready to collapse into bed. Tomorrow
we plan to walk around and see some of the local sights; despite the heat
and constant barrage of tuk-tuk drivers, the city seems pretty walkable.
How true is that? I guess we’ll find out!</p>
